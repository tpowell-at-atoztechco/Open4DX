# Open4DX
Open4dX is a open-source platform for movie theaters to incorporate special effects to their audiences in realtime.

# Who this software is for?

This software was developed by the owner of an independent movie theater, for movie theaters. It is our hope that manufacturers may pick this product up too, so that it becomes commonplace in cinemas across the country

# Why is this free?

To get it in front of as many people as we can! We're helping movie theaters create a more in-depth movie theater experience, using technology that would otherwise be unavailable to them.

# How can I help?

We're looking for interested developers to join us! Not a developer? Come check out our KickStarter:
