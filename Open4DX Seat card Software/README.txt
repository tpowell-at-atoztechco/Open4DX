This software is under development by the Open4DX group.

We neither imply nor do we guarentee this software will work in a production environment. Well, at least not yet. Use at your own risk.

PURPOSE: This software runs on the Open4DX Seat card, and communicates with the Open4DX Theater Controller card, sending data like seat activity and receiving data like special effects cues. It also supports touch screen functionality.
