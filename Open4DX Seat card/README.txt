This software is under development by the Open4DX group.

We neither imply nor do we guarentee this software will work in a production environment. Well, at least not yet. Use at your own risk.

PURPOSE: This hardware provides different versions of the Open4DX Seat controller card. While you can make it yourself with a traditional Arduino Mega or Due board, we've put together a efficient PCB schematic to handle this process easier.
