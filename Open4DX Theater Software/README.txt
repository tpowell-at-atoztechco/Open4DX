This software is under development by the Open4DX group.

We neither imply nor do we guarentee this software will work in a production environment. Well, at least not yet. Use at your own risk.

PURPOSE: This software runs on the Open4DX hardware, and does three things:

1.) Connects to the projector's IMB controller to read and adjust settings,
2.) Connects to all theater special effect modules and Open4DX seat cards, sending them cues and reading their states, and
3.) Connects back to the Open4DX Cinema Manager software to be managed.
